# PHP_Online_testing

Project is online testing. Rendering questions and correct and wrong answers.
There are 3 types of users. Admin(professor) and student  for example. Admin choose type of question easy, hard and more harder. When he 
choose it, students get questions from that collection (easy is easy is chooden). Then when they answer it, they can't do the test again.
Admin can see how much of each students have poins, and he can create new questions and answers. Also students can't access admin
pages because they have no permission. Admin can delete, update and add new students (CRUD). And students beside the test can
choose to practise. There are qustions from all types of questions rendered randomly, so the student can practise all types of
questions. Also when he miss the answer the error message is shown and when he do it correctly success message is shown.
